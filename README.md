# ChordDatabase

This is a personalizable database for keeping track of all of those complicated jazz chords. I found myself overwhelmed trying to remember exactly which chord to use, what they all feel like, and what scales I can use to play over them. Now with this snazzy MVC .NET Entity Framework project they are all at my fingertips and they can be for you too!


Here's what it looks like:
